# Favicon Creation Instructions

To complete the TimeTracker branding, please create a favicon.ico file and place it in the `img` directory:

1. Use the TimeTrackerLogo.svg as a basis for your favicon
2. Create a simple icon version of the logo at 32x32 pixels
3. Save it as `favicon.ico` in the `img` folder

You can use online tools like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to convert your logo to a favicon.

Once created, the favicon will appear in browser tabs when users access your TimeTracker application.
