# TimeTracker JavaScript Architecture

## Project Structure

This project uses a modular JavaScript architecture that separates concerns and improves maintainability:

- Core structure:
  - `app.js` - Main application entry point
  - `/components/` - UI component modules
  - `/utils/` - Shared utility functions
  - `/tools/` - Build scripts and developer utilities

## Migration Status

âœ… **Migration Complete (May 10, 2025)**

The JavaScript codebase has been successfully migrated to a modular architecture:

- All legacy script files have been removed
- All HTML files updated to use the new structure
- Utility scripts moved to the tools directory

## Development Guidelines

- All new features should be developed using the modular architecture
- Add new components to the appropriate directories
- Update existing components instead of modifying the legacy scripts
